How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
much easier than doing it manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it makes finding bugs easier and could save you a lot of time and trouble 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros of manual is you are less likely to have unwanted versions of the code . cons if you forget it wont save or if you have a technical issue while coding it wont be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs are less likely to have filed that are connected to each other . but when you are coding and working on a project you need a system that allows multiple files saving so it doesnt make any bugs in the compilation

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
using the git log command you can find the different commits you made for the repository and then you can compare between two versions using git diff.

Might be helpfull to look up commit comments:
git log --grep='Revert controls'
