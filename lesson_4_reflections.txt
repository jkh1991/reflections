lesson 4 for remote repositories on github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because you dont want to apply every change that happens automatically to your local repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
by forking you clone the needed repository from another user onto your own user on the github system itself.
cloning a repository is copying the repo from the github system onto your local machine in order to make changes to it.
branching is used in order to make another version of the project you are working on or if you would like to try a differenet approach
